    "text": "Before diving into the process, let’s briefly overview the key technologies used in this project:\n\n2.0.1 Quarto\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It allows users to convert documents written in Markdown, R Markdown, Jupyter, or Qmd to various formats including HTML, PDF, and EPUB.\n\n\n2.0.2 LaTeX\nLaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.\n\n\n2.0.3 GitHub Actions\nGitHub Actions enables automation of all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.\n\n\n2.0.4 GitHub Release\nGitHub Releases are a way to ship software to your users. It’s a GitHub feature that makes it easy to bundle source code, release notes, and links to binary files for others to use.",

    "text": "The process of generating a PDF document from Markdown using this project/template involves the following steps:\n\nWriting Content in Markdown: Authors can write the content of their book or document in Markdown, storing these files in the content/ directory.\nConfiguring Quarto: In the _quarto.yml file, authors specify the settings for Quarto to convert Markdown to LaTeX. This includes configurations such as document title, author, date, and LaTeX-specific settings.\nCommit, Tag and Push: Add the changes git add ., commit them git commit -m \"your commit comment\", create a git tag git tag -a v1.0.0 -m \"Release version 1.0.0\" and push it git push origin v1.0.0.\nUsing GitHub Actions for Automation: When changes are pushed with a git-tag to the repository, GitHub Actions, as defined in .github/workflows/, automatically triggers the build process. The workflow installs Quarto, checks out the repository content, and runs the Quarto command to convert Markdown to LaTeX and then to PDF.\nStoring the Result with GitHub Release: Once the PDF is generated, the GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates a new release and attaches the PDF document to it. This makes the document accessible to users and provides version control for each release.",
